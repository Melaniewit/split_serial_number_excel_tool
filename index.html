  This HTML file serves as the entry point for the React application.
  It includes necessary metadata, links to stylesheets, and mounts the React app.
  The script tag at the end dynamically loads the main TypeScript/React file.
  The Font Awesome stylesheet is included for icon support.
  The root div is where the React app will render its components.
  The viewport meta tag ensures proper scaling on mobile devices.
  The charset meta tag specifies the character encoding for the document.
  The title tag sets the page title displayed in the browser tab.
  The crossorigin attribute on the stylesheet link allows for CORS requests, enabling the use of Font Awesome icons.
  The type="module" attribute on the script tag indicates that the script is a JavaScript module, allowing for modern ES6+ features like imports and exports.
  The script is loaded as a module to support TypeScript and React features.
  The HTML structure is simple and focused on providing a clean entry point for the application.--->
